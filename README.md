- Path following (basic)  ✅ [path-following control](https://christianausb.github.io/vehicleControl/path_following_control.html) 
- Path following (improved with curvature profile) ✅ [path-curvature-following control](https://christianausb.github.io/vehicleControl/path_curvature_following_control.html) 
- Trajectory tracking control
- Frenet transformation of the KBM
- Motion planning
- Lateral/Longitudinal acceleration
- Safety Functions
